The oscillator is either generated internally, or externally through a signal generator or cavity oscillator. The unit amplifies the signal and sends it out to an RF connector, where it is directed to some form of transmission antenna (horn, parabolic dish, LPA, spiral). \n\nRadar illumination is used to gather data from passive implants that do not otherwise produce strong radio frequency signals; the system behaves in a manner similar to [RFID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-frequency_identification). The signal illuminates the target system and is re-radiated. \n\nThe receive antenna picks up the re-radiated signal and directs the signal to the receive input. The signal is amplified, filtered, and mixed with the transmit antenna. The result is a homodyne receiver in which the RF signal is mixed directly to baseband. The baseband video signal is ported to an external BNC connector. This connects to a processing system, such as [NIGHTWATCH](/nightwatch), an [LFS-2](/lfs-2), or [VIEWPLATE](/viewplate), to process the signal and provide the intelligence.\n\n*Unit Cost:* $40,000','2015-01-15 04:49:35','2015-01-18 04:23:12'),(110,'PICASSO','picasso','A modified cell phone from the [ANT implant catalog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA_ANT_catalog).','PICASSO is a modified cell phone ([GSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM)) handset that can collect user and location data, or eavesdrop using the handset\'s built-in microphone.\n\nIt collects the following types of data:\n\n* Incoming/outgoing call numbers\n* Recently registered networks\n* Recent location area codes (LACs)\n* Recently assigned [TMSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobility_management#TMSI)/[IMSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_mobile_subscriber_identity)\n* Recently entered pin numbers\n* \"Hot mic\" to receive audio from the built-in microphone\n* \n\nThe device can be used to track and target adversaries.

Despite the overwhelming management and financial support, however, TRAILBLAZER was abandoned in 2006 as a failed project — a $1.2 boondoggle. SAIC, the lead contractor on the project, reaped a windfall: awarded $280M in 2002 to begin working on TRAILBLAZER.\n\nThe rapid demise of the program was due, at least in part, to a scathing inspector general (IG) report that dressed down agency leaders for incompetent oversight. That IG report was marked secret (but unclassified), making it illegal to release it to the American public. [Thomas Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Andrews_Drake), an NSA insider and critic of TRAILBLAZER, leaked the secret report to the Baltimore Sun.

The program was championed by a well known cryptographer/mathematician that worked at the agency, [Bill Binney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Binney_(U.S._intelligence_official)).\n\nDesigned to address the growing problem of ever increasing data sizes, ThinThread eschewed centralized archival and data retention, instead opting for distributed and instant analysis of data. Needless data was discarded on the spot. The data was scalable to accomodate increasing amounts of data; it was also extensible to to incorporate new types of information that might be useful to an intelligence analyst.\n\n> As Binney imagined it, ThinThread would correlate data from financial transactions, travel records, Web searches, G.P.S. equipment, and any other “attributes” that an analyst might find useful in pinpointing “the bad guys.” \n\nThinThread was reportedly very successful in early testing. In fact, due to very aggressive reaping of digital data, the system\'s designers built in privacy and minimization features in order to protect the 4th amendment rights of U.S. citizens who\'s data was unexpectedly caught up in the system.\n\nBill Binney believed that ThinThread may have been able to prevent the 9/11 attacks, if the system had been put into operation soon enough. He also later apologized to the American people, believing that ThinThread had been misused against American citizens.\n\n> I should apologize to the American people. It’s violated everyone’s rights. It can be used to eavesdrop on the whole world.\n\nThinThread was ultimately rejected due to agency lawyers\' privacy concerns prior to 9/11, prompting NSA Director Michael Hayden to move forward with TRAILBLAZER instead, despite the latter being far more expensive and less effective than ThinThread.\n\nAnother supporter of ThinThread, named [Thomas Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Andrews_Drake), was later indicted under the [Espionage Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917) for leaking information challenging TRAILBLAZER and supporting ThinThread.','2015-07-21 04:24:02','2015-07-21 05:06:15'),(181,'Jackpot','jackpot','A program for finding and fixing bugs in agency software.','Mentioned only briefly in a New Yorker interview by [Thomas Drake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Andrews_Drake), Jackpot is described as, \"focussed on finding and fixing weaknesses in the agency’s software programs.\"','2015-07-21 04:38:41','2015-07-21 04:41:30'),(182,'FELONYCROWBAR','felonycrowbar','A configuration tool for [STRAITBIZARRE](/straitbizarre).','This graphical ([GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)) configuration tool is used to configure a STRAITBIZARRE implant by selecting which modules to include.

GUNMAN was an elaborate operation in the early 1980\'s to remove possibly contaminated office equipment from the US embassy in Moscow, replace it with fresh equipment, and analyze the removed equipment for the presence of any implants. Furthermore, the operation need to be performed without the knowledge of the Russians, for fear of tipping them off.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan approved the operation in 1984. The NSA and Department of State collaborated to replace hundreds of items from the embassy in Moscow and ship the removed devices back to Ft. Meade. The operation focused on cryptographic devices used in the embassy but also included samples of all of other office equipment: copy machines, typewriters, printers, teletypes, computers, etc. The agency had no idea how the implant worked or what equipment it would be buried inside of.\n\nBack at Ft. Meade, a lone engineer working late at night finally discovered the possible existence of an implant in an unlikely place: inside an IBM Selectric II typewriter. As the only employee working that late, he had to wait until the following morning to share his discovery with coworkers; further analysis and reverse engineering confirmed the employee\'s finding. The employee was rewarded with a $5,000 bonus. Additional contaminated typewriters were then removed from the Moscow embassy as well as the Leningrad embassy.\n\nKnowledge of the operation was leaked to CBS in 1985 via an unknown source. The story ran in the evening news on March 25. A top secret report on the project was written and published in the annals of the United States Cryptologic History (a publication of the NSA) in 2009. That report was declassified in 2011, approximately 25 years after the operation concluded.\n\nThe NSA considers GUNMAN to be an extremely important operation for the agency, establishing the agency\'s role within the intelligence community and creating credibility and awareness of its capabilities. The report, with a slightly propagandistic tone, extols the virtues of the NSA being able to overcome bureaucratic hurdles both within and without the agency in order to successfully execute the operation in such a short time.','2016-02-03 04:02:39','2016-02-04 16:26:42'),(255,'PINECONE','pinecone','A [SCIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information_Facility) in New Jersey that processes signals intelligence.','This \"centralized processing facility\" collects signals from the [FAIRVIEW](./fairview) program and possibly other programs, too.','2016-02-04 17:14:45','2016-02-04 17:17:51'),(256,'STELLARWIND','stellarwind','A mass surveillance program authorized by President George W.

In practice, the NSA was authorized to record any communications where one party was believed to be outside the United States. The program collected many different types of communications, including voice, data, and fax transmissions. None of these surveillance activities were conducted with a warrant, raising questions of fourth amendment violations.\n\nThe program was authorized by President George W. Bush in 2002. The program was reviewed every 45 days, and President Bush re-authorized the program at least 30 times during his presidency. Although principally an NSA surveillance program, the FBI and CIA were integral in its operations and also received data from the program.\n\nThe New York Times learned of the program in 2004, but withheld publication before that year\'s presidential election due to [pressure from the White House](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/14/james-risen-new-york-times_n_5324303.html).

This [is more money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_United_States_federal_budget) than we spent on the Department Of Commerce ($9B), the Environmental Protection Agency ($8.9B ), or the National Science Foundation ($7.5B). It is _seven times as much_ as we spent on the Small Business Administration ($1.4B)\n\nThe budget for all American intelligence agencies combined surpassed $50 billion in 2013. This figure tops spending on the Department of Housing and Urban Development ($46.3B), the Department of Justice ($36.5B), and the Department Of Energy ($35B).\n\nThe intelligence budget itself was classified information until it was leaked to the public by Edward Snowden. The absurdity of this fact should not be overlooked: the amount of money is such an important national secret that leaking the _budget_ is considered espionage! Imagine how easy it is to escape scrutiny when taxpayers don\'t even know how much of their money you are spending.\n\nThe purpose of this website is to help organize the numerous tidbits of information revealed through these leaks and allow American taxpayers to understand where their money is going. Regardless of your political beliefs about surveillance, public safety, and civil liberties, surely we can all agree that a properly functioning democracy is severely hampered by over-classification. When taxpayers _don\'t even know how much they\'re spending_, how can they possibly have a meaningful say in their government?\n\n## Organization\n\nThis site focuses on the codenames themselves: the names are equal parts _James Bond_ and _Get Smart_.

Therefore, this site lets users upload their own artwork to complement and illustrate each of the codenames. Users can vote on which images are best. In this way, we hope to crowd source an incredible collection of artwork to match the incredible data that we now have on these intelligence programs.\n\n## Get Involved\n\nThere are several ways you can get involved with this website:\n\n1. [Browse](/index/a) the site or [search](/search) for topics that interest you. Learn about these programs; educate yourself and others. Spread the word.\n2.
